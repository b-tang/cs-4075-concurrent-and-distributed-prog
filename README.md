# CS 4075 - Concurrent and Distributed Programming
### Overview
This repository contains projects and assignments for the CS4075 Concurrent and Distributed Programming course. The projects explore the core concepts of concurrency, synchronization, and distributed systems, focusing on practical implementations of parallel algorithms, communication protocols, and resource management in multi-threaded and distributed environments.

## Key Concepts Covered
- **Concurrency and Synchronization**
  - Techniques for achieving concurrency in programming, including threads, locks, and condition variables.
- **Parallel Programming**
  - Using parallelism to improve computational efficiency, including implementations with Pthreads and OpenMP.
- **Distributed Systems**
  - Concepts like network communication, distributed storage, and consensus algorithms for reliable and scalable distributed applications.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Primarily C and C++ for low-level concurrency management.
- **Libraries and Tools**: Pthreads, MPI (Message Passing Interface), and OpenMP.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/b-tang/cs-4075-concurrent-and-distributed-prog.git
   ```
3. Build Instructions
For each project, navigate to the respective directory and follow the README instructions for compilation and execution.
